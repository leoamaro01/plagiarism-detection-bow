Hey, fellow woodworkers! Welcome to my blog, where I share my passion for creating beautiful and functional things out of wood. In this post, I'm going to show you how I made this rustic coffee table from reclaimed pallet wood. It was a fun and easy project that only cost me about $20 and a few hours of work. Here's how I did it.

First, I gathered some pallets from a local warehouse. They were kind enough to let me take them for free, as they were going to throw them away anyway. I looked for pallets that were in good condition, without too many cracks or nails sticking out. I also made sure they were not treated with any chemicals, as that could be harmful for the environment and my health.

Next, I disassembled the pallets using a crowbar and a hammer. This was the most tedious part of the project, as some of the nails were really stubborn and hard to pull out. I recommend wearing gloves and eye protection for this step, as the wood can splinter and the nails can fly. I also used a metal detector to make sure I didn't miss any hidden nails in the wood.

Then, I sorted the wood planks by size and thickness. I decided to use the thicker ones for the table legs and the thinner ones for the table top. I measured and cut the planks to the desired length using a circular saw. I wanted my table to be 48 inches long, 24 inches wide and 18 inches high, so I cut four planks of 48 inches, eight planks of 24 inches and four planks of 18 inches.

After that, I sanded the planks using an orbital sander and some sandpaper. I started with a coarse grit and worked my way up to a fine grit, until the wood was smooth and splinter-free. I also rounded the edges and corners of the planks to give them a more natural look.

Next, I stained the planks using a dark walnut stain. I applied it with a brush, following the direction of the wood grain. I let it dry for about 15 minutes, then wiped off the excess with a rag. I repeated this process until I achieved the color I wanted. I also applied a coat of polyurethane to seal and protect the wood.

Then, I assembled the table using some wood glue and screws. I used a drill and a countersink bit to make pilot holes for the screws, so they would not split the wood or stick out too much. I attached two 24-inch planks to each end of a 48-inch plank, forming a U-shape. This was one side of the table top. I did the same for the other side, then joined them together with two more 48-inch planks in the middle. This was the complete table top.

Next, I attached the legs to the table top using some L-brackets and screws. I placed one bracket on each corner of the table top, then screwed it to both the top and the leg. I made sure the legs were aligned and level with each other.

Finally, I flipped over the table and admired my work. I was really happy with how it turned out. It looked rustic and cozy, perfect for my living room. It was also sturdy and durable, ready to hold my books, magazines and coffee mugs.
